        <p class="lead mb-4">A dark room, groping for the glasses by the bed; Strange ceiling, now everything in front of me is undoubtedly sending a signal to me: I have left my hometown and started my study abroad career in a foreign country. I tried to get up from bed and sit in front of my desk. With the regular sound of water droplets from the bathroom, I began to explore and communicate about the journey of writing.

	When did I start writing? To tell you the truth, I don't know. It seems that this ability has always been with everyone since they were born, especially for students. This ability has been continuously cultivated and guided by teachers and parents from kindergarten to university. This is undoubtedly to lay a good foundation for everyone's literary literacy and pave different roads for people's future ways of ideological expression. The length and width of the road, in the final analysis, depends on how people accept the knowledge obtained from different teachers and seemingly boring books. But the most important point is that when people leave basic education and become high school students or college students, whether they can write good articles or pass on their ideas to others and resonate, insight and experience become a ‚Äúhandy tool‚Äù. People are willing to see correct and fair ideas and views; People also like to see fascinating words that can make them feel good, which depends on how the creator explains a good story. For me, writing has become a part of my life. Sharing my ideas and opinions with others and getting affirmation or refutation makes me full of endless sense of achievement as well as enjoyable.

	For me, writing is not only a way to express my feelings, but also gives me confidence and encouragement when I need help most. This is one of the reasons why I insist on writing. Expression, this is undoubtedly an embarrassing and inferior behavior for me as a child. Introverted by nature, I can't imagine talking to others. I often think, maybe I should take the initiative to reveal my heart to others? But I'm afraid. I'm afraid. I don't want to imagine myself being submissive and throwing out an embarrassing topic to make the atmosphere drop to the freezing point. This makes me very introverted in primary school. The only way for me to express my feelings is to talk and write with my parents. To be exact, I didn't know what writing was at that time, but just wrote down my thoughts like a diary, or try to decorate the scene I see with gorgeous words, which will make me obtain short-term happiness and satisfaction. What really changed me was a writing competition in primary school. At that time, I also believed that no matter what form writing appeared, in the final analysis, it was a way for people to vent their emotions, so I began to concentrate on my creation and tried to transfer all my thoughts and cognition through the competition. When my article appeared in the youth magazine, I felt unprecedented happiness and satisfaction, which I had never experienced before. It was as mellow as a clear spring and as warm as the sun. Since then, now for me, it has officially become a part of my life, and I am no longer timid and introverted. Instead, I have a smile on my face.<br><br>
